## Introduction üñãÔ∏è
**EZ-OCR** is a lightweight, Gen AI-powered OCR library designed for TypeScript (Node.js) and Python (coming soon). With it's support for frontier models like GPT-4O by OpenAI and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic, ez-ocr is designed to be powerful and easily adoptable into the usual Gen AI workflows. ‚ú®

Built at [_The Hackers Playbook_]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/thehackersplaybook](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-hackers-playbook/)), it helps extract text from handwritten notes, scanned documents, and complex diagrams, making raw data accessible for workflows. At THP, we're building large-scale knowledge harnessing systems to support our mission of educating and upskilling the global tech workforce. üöÄ

## Problem Statement üí°
At _The Hackers Playbook_, we handle diverse data formats‚Äîhandwritten notes, invoices, and images of diagrams‚Äîthat demand transformation into structured text. Traditional OCR tools fall short in parsing context-rich and diverse formats. EZ-OCR steps in with AI-powered adaptability to fill this gap.

---

## Leveraging Gen AI ‚öôÔ∏è
Our solution integrates Gen AI models to:
- Enhance accuracy in text recognition from non-standard fonts, handwriting, and low-quality scans.
- Extract semantic meaning, making the text more contextually relevant.
- Support multi-format inputs, including PDFs and images.

---

## Business Applications & Use-Cases üíº
### 1. **Digital Transformation**
   - Automate document digitization across industries.
   - Convert invoices, contracts, and handwritten notes into searchable formats.

### 2. **Education & Research**
   - Extract text from lecture slides, handwritten notes, and scanned textbooks.

### 3. **Data Analytics**
   - Parse data from receipts, tickets, and forms for analytics pipelines.

### 4. **Creative Workflows**
   - Extract and organize text from design mockups, visual notes, or sketches.
